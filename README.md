ETH-AVAX_Mod-3_Project: Custom Token Smart Contract Implementation

Project Overview:
This project involves the development of a custom token smart contract that exhibits basic functionalities similar to the ERC-20 standard. The smart contract enables token minting, burning, and transferring features.

Project Description:
The implemented smart contract serves as a simplified version of an ERC-20-like token, incorporating essential functionalities commonly found in such tokens. It facilitates the token contract owner (admin) to create new tokens through minting, allows any token holder to burn their tokens (destroy them), and enables token holders to transfer tokens to other addresses.

Please note that while this implementation covers key features of ERC-20 tokens, it does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard.

Getting Started:
Installation:
To utilize this smart contract, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or create a new Solidity file within your development environment.
2. Copy and paste the provided code of the token smart contract into your Solidity file.

Program Execution:
To deploy and interact with the token contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum network or a local development network using Remix or your preferred Ethereum development environment.

2. Interact with the contract using the following functions:

   a. mintTokens(address _address, uint256 _amount): This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens to a specified address _address.

   b. burnTokens(uint256 _amount): Any token holder can use this function to burn (destroy) their tokens.

   c. transferTokens(address _toAddress, uint256 _amount): Any token holder can use this function to transfer tokens to another address _toAddress.
